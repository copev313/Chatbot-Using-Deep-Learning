# Chatbot-Using-Deep-Learning
 We use Keras, Tensorflow and NLTK to recognize the user's intent and generate the appropriate response.

## Getting Started
 Create a virtual environment and install the requirements:
 `pip install -r requirements.txt`

 Train the model:
 - Run all the code cells in the notebook 'trainer.ipynb'.

 Run the application:
 `python chat.py`
